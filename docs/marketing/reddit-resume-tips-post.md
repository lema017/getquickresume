**Flair:** Resume Help

**Title:** I found a way to ATS-check and translate your resume for free — no sign-up, no paywall. Here's my full workflow for 2026.

Saw a great post here recently about the top resume builders, and it made me realize something: almost every tool out there wants your email before you can even see if your resume is any good. You build the whole thing, hit "download," and boom — $19/month paywall. Or worse, you get a "free ATS score" that's just a blurred screenshot with a "sign up to unlock" button.

I've been job hunting on and off for a while, and I've put together a workflow that actually lets you **optimize your resume for free** before you commit to any paid tool. Sharing it here because it would've saved me a lot of wasted time.

**Step 1: Check if your resume even passes ATS (free, no account)**

Before you tweak a single bullet point, you need to know where you stand. I use [GetQuickResume's free ATS checker](https://getquickresume.com/ats-resume-checker) — you upload or paste your resume, optionally add your target role, and it gives you:

- An ATS compatibility score (1-10)
- Which sections were found vs. missing
- Keyword breakdown: hard skills, soft skills, action verbs, industry terms
- Specific improvement tips

The key thing: **no account required, no email, no credit card.** You literally paste and get results in 10 seconds. I've tested it against paid alternatives (Jobscan, Resumeworded) and the analysis is comparable for a quick sanity check.

**Step 2: Fix the basics that get 75% of resumes rejected**

Based on running dozens of resumes through ATS tools, here are the patterns that kill your score every time:

1. **Missing keywords from the job description.** ATS systems match your resume against the posting. If the job says "project management" and you wrote "managed projects," some parsers won't catch it. Mirror the exact phrasing.
2. **Fancy formatting.** Tables, columns, text boxes, headers/footers, icons — all of these break ATS parsing. Stick to a single-column layout with standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills).
3. **No metrics.** "Responsible for sales" means nothing. "Increased regional sales by 34% over 6 months" gets interviews. Every bullet should have a number if possible.
4. **PDF from Canva or design tools.** These often use image layers instead of real text. Export from Word or a dedicated resume builder that guarantees ATS-safe PDFs.
5. **Missing sections.** At minimum: Contact Info, Summary/Objective, Experience, Education, Skills. If the ATS can't find a "Skills" section, your keyword match drops to near zero.

**Step 3: If you're applying internationally — translate properly**

This one's underrated. If you're applying to jobs in another country or at a multinational, a Google Translate resume is an instant rejection. Professional resume translation keeps the tone, formatting, and ATS-friendliness intact.

[GetQuickResume has a free translator](https://getquickresume.com/resume-translator) that supports 30+ languages. Same deal — no sign-up required. You upload your resume, pick the target language, and it preserves professional phrasing. You can copy the text or download a translated PDF.

**Step 4: Tailor for every single application**

This is where most people drop the ball. One generic resume for 50 applications = 50 rejections. The ATS is literally comparing your resume to the job description. You need to adjust keywords, reorder your skills, and tweak your summary for each role.

You can do this manually (read the job posting, highlight keywords, work them into your resume) or use a tool with job-tailoring features. [GetQuickResume](https://getquickresume.com) has an AI job tailoring feature where you paste a job description and it shows you exactly which keywords you're missing and suggests changes — if you decide to create a free account, you get 1 full AI-generated resume with a PDF download, no credit card required.

**Step 5: Final check — re-run the ATS scan**

After tailoring, run it through the ATS checker one more time. You want to see your score improve and your missing keywords drop. This loop (scan → fix → scan) is what actually moves the needle.

**TL;DR workflow:**

1. ATS-check your current resume for free at [getquickresume.com/ats-resume-checker](https://getquickresume.com/ats-resume-checker)
2. Fix formatting, add metrics, mirror job description keywords
3. If applying internationally, translate properly at [getquickresume.com/resume-translator](https://getquickresume.com/resume-translator)
4. Tailor for each application (manually or with AI tools)
5. Re-scan before submitting

The whole point is: you shouldn't have to pay $20/month just to find out what's wrong with your resume. Free tools exist that give you real, actionable feedback — use them.
