## Post (copy-paste ready)

We analyzed how ATS systems score resumes.

What we found surprised even us.

Most people think ATS is a simple keyword filter.
It's not. Not anymore.

Modern systems like Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday use contextual matching.
That means listing "project management" in your skills section
while having zero mention of it in your experience
can actually hurt your score — not help it.

Here are 5 things we've learned from building an AI resume optimization engine:

1. Keywords need context, not repetition.
Stuffing your skills list doesn't work. ATS weights keywords higher when they appear inside achievement-based bullet points.

2. The order of your bullet points matters.
Most systems give more weight to content that appears earlier in each section. Your most relevant experience should lead.

3. Creative section headers confuse parsers.
"Where I've Made an Impact" sounds great to humans. ATS has no idea what to do with it. Stick with standard headers: Work Experience, Education, Skills.

4. PDF isn't always the safest format.
Some legacy systems (especially Taleo) still parse .docx more reliably. If you're applying to large enterprises and hearing nothing back, test both.

5. You don't need a 100% match score.
Recruiters typically set their threshold at 60–70%. Your goal isn't to game the system — it's to cross that line so a human actually reads your resume.

The job market is tough enough without your resume getting filtered out before anyone sees it.

That's why we built GetQuickResume — to give job seekers a real-time ATS score, keyword gap analysis, and AI suggestions that actually align with how these systems work.

Not guesswork. Not templates. Real optimization based on how hiring technology reads resumes today.

## Strategy Notes

- **First 3 lines are the hook** — they appear before LinkedIn's "see more" fold. The curiosity gap drives clicks to expand.
- **Numbered list format** increases dwell time and saves/shares.
- **Product mention comes at the end**, after full value is delivered — feels earned, not forced.
- **CTA asks a question** — comments boost reach dramatically. Frustration-based questions invite emotional, longer responses.
- **No external link in the body** — LinkedIn suppresses posts with outbound links. The company page itself links to getquickresume.com.
- **Tone is expert but accessible** — not corporate, not salesy.

## Optional Enhancements

- Add a simple graphic or carousel showing a "before vs. after" ATS score (visual posts get 2–3x engagement).
- Pin this post on the company page.
- After posting, comment from your personal account: "We've been testing this for months. Happy to answer specifics about any ATS system."
